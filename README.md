### ✨ Hi there 👋

My work is best accessed at [https://krrish94.github.io](https://krrish94.github.io)

- 🔭 I work on [robotics / computer vision / graphics] + deep learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tons of cool stuff in all the above areas (and beyond).
- 👯 I’m frequently looking for collaborators on my projects. If that's you, let's get in touch!
- 💬 Ask me about research or grad school advice (and anything else -- although I might only be able to reply meaningfully if the ask is specific, and within my areas of expertise).
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me (and vey rarely, DM [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_krishna_murthy)).
- 😄 Pronouns: he / him
- ⚡ Fun fact: You can get one such summary too -- just create a GitHub repo with the name exactly matching your username, and anything you write in the repo's README will show up here.
